### Do you not see the cluster you expect in the Cluster List page or in results returned from ListClusters API?<a name="w368aac31c31c43b2"></a>

Check the following:
+ The cluster age is less than two months\. Amazon EMR preserves metadata information about completed clusters for your reference, at no charge, for two months\. The console does not provide a way to delete completed clusters from the console; these are automatically removed for you after two months\.
+ You have permissions to view the cluster\.
+ You are viewing the correct region\.
