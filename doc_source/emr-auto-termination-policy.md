# Using an auto\-termination policy<a name="emr-auto-termination-policy"></a>

An auto\-termination policy lets you orchestrate cluster cleanup without the need to monitor and manually terminate unused clusters\. When you add an auto\-termination policy to a cluster, you specify the amount of idle time after which the cluster should automatically shut down\. 

Depending on release version, Amazon EMR uses different criteria to mark a cluster as idle\. The following table outlines how Amazon EMR determines cluster idleness\.


****  

| When you use \.\.\. | A cluster is considered idle when \.\.\. | 
| --- | --- | 
| Amazon EMR versions 6\.4\.0 and later |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-auto-termination-policy.html)  | 
| Amazon EMR versions 5\.30\.0 \- 5\.33\.0 and 6\.1\.0 \- 6\.3\.0 |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-auto-termination-policy.html)  Amazon EMR marks a cluster as idle and may automatically terminate the cluster even if you have an active Python3 kernel\. This is because executing a Python3 kernel does not submit a Spark job on the cluster\. To use auto\-termination with a Python3 kernel, we recommend that you use Amazon EMR version 6\.4\.0 or later\.   | 

**Note**  
Amazon EMR versions 6\.4\.0 and later support an on\-cluster file for detecting activity on the master node: `/emr/metricscollector/isbusy`\. When you use a cluster to run shell scripts or non\-YARN applications, you can periodically touch or update `isbusy` to tell Amazon EMR that the cluster is not idle\.

You can attach an auto\-termination policy when you create a cluster, or add a policy to an existing cluster\. To change or disable auto\-termination, you can update or remove the policy\.

## Considerations<a name="emr-auto-termination-considerations"></a>

Consider the following features and limitations before using an auto\-termination policy:
+ Auto\-termination is supported with Amazon EMR versions 5\.30\.0 and 6\.1\.0 and later\. 
+ Auto\-termination is available in the following AWS Regions: US East \(N\. Virginia, Ohio\), US West \(N\. California, Oregon\), Asia Pacific \(Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo\), Canada \(Central\), China \(Beijing, Ningxia\), Europe \(Ireland, Frankfurt, London, Paris, Stockholm\), South America \(SÃ£o Paulo\)\.
+ Idle timeout defaults to 60 minutes \(one hour\) when you don't specify an amount\. You can specify a minimum idle timeout of one minute, and a maximum idle timeout of 7 days\.
+ With Amazon EMR versions 6\.4\.0 and later, auto\-termination is enabled by default when you create a new cluster using the Amazon EMR console\.
+ Amazon EMR publishes high\-resolution Amazon CloudWatch metrics when you enable auto\-termination for a cluster\. You can use these metrics to track cluster activity and idleness\. For more information, see [Cluster capacity metrics](UsingEMR_ViewingMetrics.md#emr-metrics-managed-scaling)\.
+ Auto\-termination is not supported when you use non\-YARN based applications such as Presto, Trino, or HBase\.

## Permissions to use auto\-termination<a name="emr-auto-termination-permissions"></a>

Before you can apply and manage auto\-termination policies for Amazon EMR, you need the permissions that are listed in the following example IAM permissions policy\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
      "Sid": "AllowAutoTerminationPolicyActions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "elasticmapreduce:PutAutoTerminationPolicy",
        "elasticmapreduce:GetAutoTerminationPolicy",
        "elasticmapreduce:RemoveAutoTerminationPolicy"
      ],
      "Resource": "<your-resources>"
    }
}
```

## Attach, update, or remove an auto\-termination policy<a name="emr-auto-termination-attach"></a>

This section includes instructions to help you attach, update, or remove an auto\-termination policy from an Amazon EMR cluster\. Before you work with auto\-termination policies, make sure you have the necessary IAM permissions\. See [Permissions to use auto\-termination](#emr-auto-termination-permissions)\.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To attach an auto\-termination policy when you create a cluster**

1. Open the Amazon EMR console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/elasticmapreduce/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/)\.

1. Choose **Create cluster**\.

1. Under **Hardware configuration**, select **Auto\-termination**\.

1. Specify the number of idle hours and minutes after which the cluster should auto\-terminate\. The default idle time is one hour\.

1. Choose other settings as appropriate for your application, and then choose **Create cluster**\.

**To attach an auto\-termination policy when you create an EMR notebook**

1. Open the Amazon EMR console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/elasticmapreduce/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/)\.

1. Choose **Notebooks**, then choose **Create notebook**\.

1. Choose **Create a cluster**\.

1. Select **Enable auto\-termination**, then specify the number of idle hours and minutes after which the cluster should auto\-terminate\. The default idle time is one hour\.

1. Choose other settings as appropriate for your EMR notebook, and then choose **Create notebook**\.

**To attach, update, or remove an auto\-termination policy on a running cluster**

1. Open the Amazon EMR console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/elasticmapreduce/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/)\.

1. Select **Clusters** and choose the cluster you want to update\.

1. Choose the **Hardware** tab on the cluster detail page\.

1. Select or clear **Enable auto\-termination** to enable or disable the feature\. If you enable auto\-termination, specify the number of idle hours and minutes after which the cluster should auto\-terminate\.

#### [ AWS CLI ]

**Before you start**

Before you work with auto\-termination policies, we recommend that you update to the latest version of the AWS CLI\. For instructions, see [Installing, updating, and uninstalling the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)\.

**To attach or update an auto\-termination policy using the AWS CLI**
+ You can use the `aws emr put-auto-termination-policy` command to attach or update an auto\-termination policy on a cluster\. 

  The following example specifies 3600 seconds for *IdleTimeout*\. If you don't specify *IdleTimeout*, the value defaults to one hour\. 

  ```
  aws emr put-auto-termination-policy \
  --cluster-id <your-cluster-id> \
  --auto-termination-policy IdleTimeout=3600
  ```
**Note**  
Linux line continuation characters \(\\\) are included for readability\. They can be removed or used in Linux commands\. For Windows, remove them or replace with a caret \(^\)\.

  You can also specify a value for `--auto-termination-policy` when you use the `aws emr create-cluster` command\. For more information on using Amazon EMR commands in the AWS CLI, see the [AWS CLI Command Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/emr)\.

**To remove an auto\-termination policy using the AWS CLI**
+ Use the `aws emr remove-auto-termination-policy` command to remove an auto\-termination policy from a cluster\. For more information on using Amazon EMR commands in the AWS CLI, see the [AWS CLI Command Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/emr)\.

  ```
  aws emr remove-auto-termination-policy --cluster-id <your-cluster-id>
  ```
