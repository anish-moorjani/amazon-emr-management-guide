# Using Amazon EMR block public access<a name="emr-block-public-access"></a>

Amazon EMR block public access prevents a cluster in a public subnet from launching when any security group associated with the cluster has a rule that allows inbound traffic from IPv4 0\.0\.0\.0/0 or IPv6 ::/0 \(public access\) on a port, unless the port has been specified as an exception\. Port 22 is an exception by default\. You can configure exceptions to allow public access on a port or range of ports\. Block public access does not take effect in private subnets\. 

Block public access is enabled for each AWS Region for your AWS account\. In other words, each Region has block public access enabled for all clusters created by your account in that Region\.

**Important**  
We do not recommend turning off block public access for your account\.

Block public access is only applicable during cluster creation\. Block public access does not block IAM principals with appropriate permissions from updating security group configurations to allow public access on running clusters\.

Block public access is an account level configuration that helps you centrally manage public network access to Amazon EMR clusters in a Region\. When account users launch clusters in the Region where you have enabled block public access configuration, Amazon EMR checks the port rules defined in the configuration and compare it with inbound traffic rules specified in the security groups associated with the clusters\. If these security groups have inbound rules that open ports to the public IP address but these ports are not configured as exceptions in block public access configuration, Amazon EMR will fail the cluster creation and send an exception to the user\. 

You can update security groups and the block public access configuration in your accounts at any time\. Amazon EMR does not check your clusters that are already running against block public access configuration after such updates and will not fail clusters that are already running\.

## Configure block public access<a name="configure-block-public-access"></a>

You can enable and disable block public access settings using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, and the Amazon EMR API\. Settings apply across your account on a Region\-by\-Region basis\. To maintain cluster security, it's recommended that you keep BPA enabled\.

### To configure block public access using the AWS Management Console<a name="configure-bpa-console"></a>

1. Open the Amazon EMR console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/elasticmapreduce/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/)\.

1. On the navigation bar, make sure that the **Region** you want to configure is selected\.

1. Choose **Block public access**\.

1. Under **Block public access settings**, complete the following steps\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-block-public-access.html)

### To configure block public access using the AWS CLI<a name="configure-bpa-cli"></a>

Use the `aws emr put-block-public-access-configuration` command to configure block public access as shown in the following examples\.


| To\.\.\. | Do this\.\.\. | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Turn block public access on  |  Set `BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules` to `true` as shown in the following example\. For the cluster to launch, no security group associated with a cluster can have an inbound rule that allows public access\. <pre>aws emr put-block-public-access-configuration --block-public-access-configuration BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules=true</pre>  | 
|  Turn block public access off  |  Set `BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules` to `false` as shown in the following example\. Security groups associated with a cluster can have inbound rules that allow public access on any port\. We do not recommend this configuration\. <pre>aws emr put-block-public-access-configuration --block-public-access-configuration BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules=false</pre>  | 
|  Turn block public access on and specify ports as exceptions  |  The following example turns on block public access, and specifies Port 22 and Ports 100\-101 as exceptions\. This allows clusters to be created if an associated security group has an inbound rule that allows public access on Port 22, Port 100, or Port 101\. <pre>aws emr put-block-public-access-configuration --block-public-access-configuration  '{ "BlockPublicSecurityGroupRules": true, "PermittedPublicSecurityGroupRuleRanges": [ { "MinRange": 22, "MaxRange": 22 }, { "MinRange": 100, "MaxRange": 101 } ] }'</pre>  |
