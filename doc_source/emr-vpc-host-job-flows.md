# Set up a VPC to host clusters<a name="emr-vpc-host-job-flows"></a>

Before you can launch clusters in a VPC, you must create a VPC and a subnet\. For public subnets, you must create an internet gateway and attach it to the subnet\. The following instructions describe how to create a VPC capable of hosting Amazon EMR clusters\. 

**To create a VPC with subnets for an Amazon EMR cluster**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. On the top\-right of the page, choose the [ AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) for your VPC\.

1. Choose **Launch VPC Wizard**\.
**Note**  
Do not choose **Your VPCs** in the navigation pane; you cannot access the VPC wizard using the **Create VPC** button on that page\. 

1.  Choose the VPC configuration by selecting one of the following options: 
   + **VPC with a Single Public Subnet**—Select this option if the data used by the cluster is available on the internet \(for example, in Amazon S3 or Amazon RDS\)\.
   + **VPC with Public and Private subnets and Hardware VPN Access**—Select this option to use a private subnet or if data for your application is stored in your own network \(for example, in an Oracle database\)\. This option also allows you to include public subnets within the same VPC as private subnets\.

1. On the configuration page, enter a name for your VPC in the **VPC name** field and enter a name for your subnet in the **Subnet name** field\. This helps you to identify the VPC and subnet in the Amazon VPC console after you've created them\. Confirm the other VPC settings, using the information below as a guide\.
   + To work with Amazon EMR, the VPC with a public subnet must have both an internet gateway and a subnet\.

     For a VPC in a private subnet, all Amazon EC2 instances must at minimum have a route to Amazon EMR through the elastic network interface\. In the console, this is automatically configured for you\.
   + Use a private IP address space for your VPC to ensure proper DNS hostname resolution; otherwise, you may experience Amazon EMR cluster failures\. This includes the following IP address ranges: 
     + 10\.0\.0\.0 \- 10\.255\.255\.255
     + 172\.16\.0\.0 \- 172\.31\.255\.255
     + 192\.168\.0\.0 \- 192\.168\.255\.255
   + Choose **Use a NAT instance instead** and select options as appropriate\.
   + Optionally choose to **Add endpoints for Amazon S3 to your subnets**\.
   + Verify that **Enable DNS hostnames** is checked\. You have the option to enable DNS hostnames when you create the VPC\. To change the setting of DNS hostnames, select your VPC in the VPC list, then choose **Edit** in the details pane\. To create a DNS entry that does not include a domain name, create a value for **DHCP Options Set**, and then associate it with your VPC\. You cannot edit the domain name using the console after the DNS option set has been created\.

     For more information, see [Using DNS with your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html)\.
   + It is a best practice with Hadoop and related applications to ensure resolution of the fully qualified domain name \(FQDN\) for nodes\. To ensure proper DNS resolution, configure a VPC that includes a DHCP options set whose parameters are set to the following values:
     + **domain\-name** = **ec2\.internal**

       Use **ec2\.internal** if your Region is US East \(N\. Virginia\)\. For other Regions, use *region\-name***\.compute\.internal**\. For examples in `us-west-2`, use **us\-west\-2\.compute\.internal**\. For the AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\) Region, use **us\-gov\-west\-1\.compute\.internal**\.
     + **domain\-name\-servers** = **AmazonProvidedDNS**

     For more information, see [DHCP options sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

1. Choose **Create VPC**\. If you are creating a NAT instance, it may take a few minutes for this to complete\.

1. A status window shows the work in progress\. When the work completes, choose **OK** to close the status window\. The **Your VPCs** page displays your default VPC and the VPC that you just created\. The VPC that you created is a nondefault VPC, therefore the **Default VPC** column displays **No**\. 

1. After the VPC is created, go to the **Subnets** page and note the identifier of one of the subnets of your VPC\. You use this information when you launch the Amazon EMR cluster into the VPC\.
