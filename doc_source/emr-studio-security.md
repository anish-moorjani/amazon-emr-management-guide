# Configure EMR Studio security<a name="emr-studio-security"></a>

This section helps you understand and configure the security features that EMR Studio uses to interact with other AWS services\. You can also find information in this section about how to manage permissions for Studio users\. 

The security features covered in this section don't enforce data access control\. To manage access to input datasets, you should configure permissions for the clusters that your Studio uses\. For more information, see [Security in Amazon EMR](emr-security.md)\.
