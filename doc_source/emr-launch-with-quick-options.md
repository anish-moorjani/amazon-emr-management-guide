# Launch a cluster with Quick Options<a name="emr-launch-with-quick-options"></a>

Use the **Create Cluster \- Quick Options** page in the Amazon EMR console to quickly create a cluster for simple tasks or for evaluation or testing purposes\. **Quick Options** uses default values for configuration options like cluster software, networking, and security\. For example, when you launch a cluster with **Quick Options**, you do not select a Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\) and subnet for your cluster\. Instead, Amazon EMR sets up a cluster in the public subnet of your default Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) for your selected Region\.

**To launch a cluster with **Quick Options****

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EMR console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/elasticmapreduce/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/)\.

1. Choose **Clusters**, and then choose **Create cluster** to open the **Quick Options** page\.

1. On the **Create Cluster \- Quick Options** page, enter or select values for the provided fields\. For more information about the Quick Option fields, see [Summary of Quick Options](#emr-quick-cluster-options)\.

1. Choose **Create cluster** to launch the cluster and open the cluster status page\.

1. On the cluster status page, find the cluster **Status** next to the cluster name\. The status should change from **Starting** to **Running** to **Waiting** during the cluster creation process\. You may need to choose the refresh icon on the right or refresh your browser to receive updates\.

When the status changes to **Waiting**, your cluster is up, running, and ready to accept steps and SSH connections\.

## Summary of Quick Options<a name="emr-quick-cluster-options"></a>

The following table describes the fields and default values when you launch a cluster using the **Create Cluster \- Quick Options** page in the Amazon EMR console\.


| Console field | Default value | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Cluster name | My cluster | The cluster name is an optional, descriptive name for your cluster that does not need to be unique\. | 
| Logging | Selected | When logging is enabled, Amazon EMR writes detailed log data to the specified Amazon S3 folder\. Logging can only be enabled at cluster creation\. You can't change the setting later\. **Quick Options** chooses a default Amazon S3 bucket\. You can optionally specify your own bucket\. For more information, see [View log files archived to Amazon S3](emr-manage-view-web-log-files.md#emr-manage-view-web-log-files-s3)\. | 
| S3 folder | elasticmapreduce/ | This option specifies the path to a folder in an Amazon S3 bucket where you want Amazon EMR to write log data\. If the default folder in the specified path does not exist in the bucket, Amazon EMR creates it for you\. You can specify a different folder by entering a folder name or by browsing to an Amazon S3 folder\.  | 
| Launch mode | Cluster | This option specifies whether to launch a long\-running cluster, or a cluster that terminates after running any steps that you specify at the time of creation\. With the **Cluster** option, the cluster continues to run until you terminate it; this is called a long\-running cluster\. If you choose **Step execution**, Amazon EMR prompts you to add and configure steps\. You can use steps to submit work to a cluster\. After the steps that you specify finish running, the cluster terminates automatically\. For more information, see [Configuring a cluster to continue or terminate after step execution](emr-plan-longrunning-transient.md)\.  | 
| Release | emr\-5\.34\.0  | This option specifies the Amazon EMR release version to use when the cluster is created\. The Amazon EMR release determines the version of open\-source applications, such as Hadoop and Hive, that Amazon EMR installs\. The label for the latest release version is selected by default\. You can select an earlier Amazon EMR release if you need different versions of open\-source applications for compatibility with your solution\. Some Amazon EMR features and applications may not be available when using earlier Amazon EMR release versions\. We recommend you use the latest release version whenever possible\. For more information about each Amazon EMR release version, see [Amazon EMR Release Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/)\. | 
| Applications | Core Hadoop | This option determines the open\-source applications from the big data ecosystem to install on your cluster\. **Quick Options** lets you select from the most common application combinations\. To select your own combination of applications, including additional applications not listed, choose **Go to advanced options**\. For information about the applications and versions available with each Amazon EMR release version, see [Amazon EMR Release Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/)\. If an application isn't available for Amazon EMR to install, or you need to install a custom application on all cluster instances, you can use a bootstrap action\. For more information, see [Create bootstrap actions to install additional software](emr-plan-bootstrap.md)\. If you select **Step execution**, Amazon EMR chooses the applications to install based on what your steps require\. | 
| Use AWS Glue Data Catalog for table metadata | Disabled | When enabled, specifies the AWS Glue Data Catalog as an external Hive metastore\. For more information, see [Using the AWS Glue Data Catalog as the metastore for Hive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-hive-metastore-glue.html)\. | 
| Instance type | m5\.xlarge | This option determines the Amazon EC2 instance type that Amazon EMR initializes for the instances that run in your cluster\. The default instance selection varies by Region and some instance types may not be available in some Regions\. For more information, see [Configure cluster hardware and networking](emr-plan-instances.md)\. | 
| Number of instances | 3 | This option determines the number of Amazon EC2 instances to initialize\. Each instance corresponds to a node in the Amazon EMR cluster\. You must have at least one node, which is the master node\. For guidance about choosing instance types and the number of instances, see [Cluster configuration guidelines and best practices](emr-plan-instances-guidelines.md)\. | 
| Cluster scaling | Unselected | When selected, cluster scaling enables EMR\-managed scaling\. Managed scaling automatically increases and decreases the number of instances in core and task nodes based on workload\. For more information, see [Using EMR managed scaling in Amazon EMR](emr-managed-scaling.md)\. | 
| Auto\-termination | Enabled for Amazon EMR release versions 6\.4\.0 and later, with a default idle time of one hour\. For other supported versions of Amazon EMR, auto\-termination is disabled by default\. | When enabled, lets you attach an auto\-termination policy to the cluster\. In the policy, you specify the amount of idle time after which the cluster automatically shuts down\. For more information, see [Using an auto\-termination policy](emr-auto-termination-policy.md)\. | 
| EC2 key pair | Choose an option | This specifies the Amazon EC2 key pair to use when connecting to the nodes in your cluster over a Secure Shell \(SSH\) connection\. We strongly recommend that you create and specify an Amazon EC2 key pair\. If you do not select a key pair, you cannot connect to the cluster to submit steps or interact with applications\. For more information, see [Connect to the cluster](emr-connect-master-node.md)\. To connect, you also need to create an inbound rule in the security group to allow SSH connections\. | 
| Permissions | Default | Use this option to specify the AWS Identity and Access Management roles that the cluster uses\. These roles determine the permissions required for Amazon EMR and the applications running on cluster instances to interact with other AWS services\. You can choose **Custom** to specify your own roles\. We recommend starting with the default roles\. For more information, see [Configure IAM service roles for Amazon EMR permissions to AWS services and resources](emr-iam-roles.md)\. | 
| EMR role | EMR\_DefaultRole | The service role that allows Amazon EMR to call other AWS Services, such as Amazon EC2, on your behalf\. For more information, see [Service role for Amazon EMR \(EMR role\)](emr-iam-role.md)\. | 
| EC2 instance profile | EMR\_EC2\_DefaultRole | Provides access to other AWS services, such as Amazon S3 and DynamoDB, from Amazon EC2 instances that are launched by Amazon EMR\. For more information, see [Service role for cluster EC2 instances \(EC2 instance profile\)](emr-iam-role-for-ec2.md)\. |
